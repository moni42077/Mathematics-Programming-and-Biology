# Introduction
Using numerical computation to solve some of the core well known models in mathematical biology. Inspired by the Mathematical Biology module lead by Dr Martín López-García I took in my BSc.

## Deterministic modelling 

Will look at Exponential Growth, Dynamics of a single population and T-cells population

## Stochastic modelling 
Predator-Prey model, Two Odes, SIR Epidemic Model, Enzyme kinetics, Viruses
